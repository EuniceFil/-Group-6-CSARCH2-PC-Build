## 1. Introduction
Briefly describe your project build (1–2 paragraphs).  
Mention: target use case (e.g., general-purpose desktop, gaming, programming, data science, etc.) and budget constraint.
The custom PC Build we have created is an AMD-based budget-tier gaming PC. Its target use case is for gaming and should be suitable for light 720p gaming with a budget constraint of ₱20,000. Some games include League Of Legends, Portal and Underlords with lowered settings. These games have recommended PC system requirements and we aimed to match all of them while staying within the budget. Using PCPartPicker’s system builder, we were able to create a PC build with compatible parts while ensuring that all parts are available locally. 

The PC build uses an AMD Ryzen 5 5500, a 6-core processor that provides a solid performance for gaming at a budget level, paired with a GIGABYTE A520M-K V2 micro-ATX motherboard for stable compatibility. Compatible with the CPU is a Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE CPU cooler and a MSI MAG A550BN power supply. Since the motherboard size supports mATX, the components are placed in a Tecware NEO M2 mATX case with a Thermalright ARGB case fan. For the memory, the system uses 8GB of DDR4 RAM and the graphics card is a PowerColor AMD Radeon RX 550 2GB that fits the case and is compatible with the power supply. The recommended requirement for light 720p gaming is having a 16GB free disk storage and thus, the PC build contains a 250GB NVME M.2 SSD that provides sufficient load times without needing to include a traditional hard disk drive. All in all, the build is priced at ₱19,914 which is within budget, available locally and matches its target use case for light gaming.

## 4. Compatibility Justification
For each part, explain compatibility and choices.  
 
- **CPU + Motherboard**: AMD Ryzen 5 5500 3.6 GHz 6-Core Processor (AM4) works with GIGABYTE A520M-K V2 micro-ATX Motherboard (AM4 socket, BIOS compatible).
- **CPU Cooler**: Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE fits the case with 175 mm max height clearance (actual cooler height ~155 mm).
- **RAM**: DDR4 RAM is compatible with the motherboard slots (up to 128GB supported).
- **GPU**: PowerColor AMD Radeon RX 550 Low Profile Graphics Card with 2GB GDDR5 fits the case (actual length: ~167 mm; GPU clearance: 330 mm max) and is low-power, so the 550W PSU is sufficient.
- **Storage 1**: NVMe M.2 slot supported on motherboard.
- **PSU**: MSI MAG A550BN is compatible with Ryzen 5 5500 and provides enough power for the system, including the RX 550 GPU. PSU length 150 mm fits within the 160 mm clearance of the case.
- **Case**: Tecware NEO M2 Steel Black Mesh mATX Case supports micro-ATX & ITX motherboards.
